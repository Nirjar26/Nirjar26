About Me
I'm a final-year BCA student with hands-on experience in AWS Cloud Computing and a strong interest in backend development and cloud security. I focus on understanding how modern applications are built, secured, and deployed in cloud environments.
Through academic projects and AWS Skill Builder labs, I've gained practical experience with EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, and CloudWatch. I build small-to-medium projects to understand authentication systems, secure API design, and cloud-ready architecture—combining backend logic with cloud infrastructure fundamentals.


Current Focus:
Preparing for AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect – Associate certifications
Learning Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation, Terraform) and automation scripting
Exploring real-world cloud deployment and cost optimization


Core Competencies

Cloud & AWS

Amazon EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch
AWS CLI, Cloud Security Basics
Shared Responsibility Model
Cost & Billing Awareness

Programming 

Python (Intermediate – Scripting & APIs)

Security Fundamentals

Password Hashing (Argon2id, bcrypt)
Multi-Factor Authentication (TOTP, Backup Codes)
Secure Coding Practices
IAM & Least-Privilege Policies

Databases & Tools

SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL (Basics)
Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL – Basic)
Linux Fundamentals, Bash Scripting
JSON/YAML Configuration


Practical Experience
AWS Cloud Hands-On Lab

Designed and deployed a secure AWS environment using EC2 instances within a custom VPC
Implemented security groups restricting inbound traffic to SSH and HTTP only, reducing unnecessary exposure
Provisioned EC2 instances with key-pair authentication and appropriate sizing for controlled access
Created IAM users and roles with least-privilege policies to separate administrative and operational access
Monitored system health using Amazon CloudWatch, tracking CPU utilization and instance status
Reviewed AWS billing dashboards to identify cost drivers and apply basic cost-optimization concepts

Virtual Lab Practice

Practiced AWS shared responsibility boundaries across compute, storage, and networking layers
Performed Linux user and permission management to reinforce OS-level security fundamentals
Used VMware and VirtualBox to simulate isolated cloud and security lab environments


Education
Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) – Final Year (Pursuing)
Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT), Changa
CGPA: 8.61 / 10 (after 5 semesters)
Relevant Coursework:

AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials – Course Completion

🏗️ AWS Solutions Architect – Associate


What I'm Building
I focus on projects that combine cloud infrastructure with secure backend development:

Cloud-deployed APIs with authentication and authorization
Secure password managers using AES-256 encryption and zero-knowledge architecture
Multi-factor authentication systems with TOTP and backup codes
AWS-hosted applications leveraging EC2, S3, and IAM for security
